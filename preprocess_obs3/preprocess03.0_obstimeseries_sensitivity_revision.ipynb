    "The data availability threshold influences our results by determining the “start year” in which observations are considered complete running into the future. This influences both the trend at any given year (since it may start earlier or later with a different availability threshold) and the envelope of internal variability (since a longer and earlier beginning trend has less internal variability). The estimate the impact of our threshold on the results, we have recalculated the start date with more (5%) and less (30%) stringent thresholds. The change in record start years is now included as a supplementary figure (Figure S??). Overall, we see that the influence of the availability threshold on the start year is small (<X years) in most regions.\n"
